<H4> Natalia Szczurek </H4>
<p> <em>According</em> <b>to</b>  the city's January 2023 Point-In-Time survey, about 6,139 people in Chicago experience homelessness on any given day. An August 2023 report from the local advocacy group Chicago Coalition for the Homeless further estimated that 68,440 people were homeless in Chicago as of 2021. The Coalition for the Homeless is also a major backer of the referendum, openly urging for more city funding to combat homelessness in its 2023 report.</p>
